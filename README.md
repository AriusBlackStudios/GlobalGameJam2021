# GlobalGameJam2021

For the 2021 Global Game Jam, We made this game.
"Sir Founder, Hamster King of Lost things"
a funny little game about an insane hamster in new Orleans.
This project is actually being revitalized after the jam becuase the team really liked it's potential, and want to give it a fair fight.

my role in this project was the lead programmer, and aside from some fragments of code, i mde all of this in 48 hours. It was my first jam ever, so all things considered,
i think it went smoothly. 
There were definately things that could have been done better that i will arry with me to the next jam
